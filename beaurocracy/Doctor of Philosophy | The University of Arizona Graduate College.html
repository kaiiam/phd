</ul><h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>Graduate students are responsible for knowing the graduate 
requirements of both the Graduate College and their academic 
departments.&nbsp;The University of Arizona offers five doctoral 
degrees: the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), the Doctor of Education 
(Ed.D.), the Doctor of Audiology (Au.D.), the Doctor of Public Health 
(D.P.H.), and the Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.). The University of 
Arizona also offers a first professional degree, the Doctor of Pharmacy 
(PharmD). For information on the PharmD, please refer to the <a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">General Catalog<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>.&nbsp;The <a href="http://catalog.arizona.edu/" class="ext" target="_blank" rel=" noopener noreferrer">UA General Catalog<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>&nbsp;also&nbsp;provides&nbsp;definitive
 information regarding Graduate Minors and&nbsp;doctoral Second Language
 Requirements, as well as the Academic Calendar.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="credit-requirements"></a>Credit Requirements and Transfer Credit</h2>

<p>The equivalent of at least six semesters of full-time graduate study 
is required for the Ph.D. A minimum of 36 units of coursework in the 
area of the major subject, 9 units in the minor subject, and 18 units of
 dissertation must be completed.&nbsp; Most students will take more than
 the minimum number of units for a given degree.</p>

<p>All grades for Incompletes and current semester coursework must be 
received before the degree is considered completed. A student must have a
 cumulative GPA in all graduate coursework of at least 3.000 in order to
 graduate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All required units of credit counted toward the degree must be taken 
for graduate credit, including any courses transferred from another 
institution.&nbsp; The only exception is that students admitted to the 
program prior to Fall 2014 may use up to 6 units of 400-level credit 
taken at the University of Arizona in the minor if not used toward an 
undergraduate degree. (These units will not receive graduate credit or 
be calculated in the graduate grade-point average.)&nbsp; At least 22 
units (i.e. half the required coursework) on the Doctoral Plan of Study 
must be in courses in which regular grades (A, B, C) have been earned. 
Courses for which the student has earned a&nbsp;<span>D&nbsp;</span><span>grade
 cannot be counted toward a graduate degree. While a grade of D or E 
does not earn units for a grad student, they will still figure into the 
GPA.&nbsp;&nbsp; A minimum of 12 units of regular grades taken at the 
University of Arizona are required to establish the Grade Point Average 
(GPA).</span></p>

<p>Non-credit based requirements such as comprehensive exams, 
dissertations or thesis requirements, research requirements, and 
professionalization requirements may not be transferred from another 
institution.</p>

<h3>Transfer Credit</h3>

<p>Graduate credit earned at other approved institutions may be counted 
toward the requirements of a doctoral degree, but will not be included 
in the calculation of the University of Arizona GPA</p>

<p>Transferred units are subject to the following restrictions:</p>

<ul><li>The credits must be approved by the major or minor department and the Graduate College.</li>
	<li>The minimum grade for transferred credits must be an A or B or the equivalent at the institution where course was taken.</li>
	<li>Transferred units may not count toward more than one doctorate.</li>
	<li>A maximum of 30 units of transfer coursework may be used toward the Ph.D requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Students who wish to transfer credit must submit a&nbsp;Transfer
 Credit&nbsp;form in GradPath before the end of their first year of 
study to have the courses evaluated for transfer eligibility.</p>

<p>Grades and the number of units for transfer credits may be adjusted 
so that they are consistent with the University of Arizona grading and 
credit system. Transfer credits used on a fully approved Plan of Study 
appear with a grade of “T” on the University of Arizona transcript and 
are not calculated in the University of Arizona GPA. The name of the 
transfer institution appears on the University of Arizona transcript 
with the number of transfer units from that institution that were 
brought in towards the graduate degree.</p>

<h3>Courses Shared Between Degrees</h3>

<p>There are limits on coursework that can be counted toward more than 
one degree earned by the student at the University of Arizona or 
elsewhere.</p>

<ul><li>If a student counts credits from a UA master's degree towards a 
UA Ph.D., then additional transfer credit may be limited to ensure that 
some UA coursework is taken while in the doctoral program.&nbsp; Thesis 
credits used for a master's degree cannot count toward the Ph.D. course 
credit requirements.</li>
	<li>Up to 30 units of credit counted toward one or more master’s 
degrees earned at UA or elsewhere may be counted toward the Ph.D 
requirements.</li>
	<li>No course may be counted toward the requirements for more than two degrees (earned at UA or elsewhere).</li>
	<li>No course counted toward a bachelor’s degree may be counted toward Ph.D requirements.</li>
	<li>A student earning two UA doctoral degrees may use up to 9 units of 
coursework toward both doctoral degrees (as long as courses were not 
used toward any other degree).</li>
</ul><h3>Graduate Non-Degree Coursework</h3>

<p>Students who have completed graduate non-degree coursework at UA may 
count no more than 12 units of non-degree credit toward the Ph.D 
requirements</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="continuous-enrollment"></a>Continuous Enrollment</h2>

<p>A student admitted to a doctoral program must register each fall and 
spring semester for a minimum of 3 graduate units from original 
matriculation until the completion of all course requirements, written 
and oral comprehensive exams, and 18 dissertation units. When these 
requirements are met, doctoral students not on financial assistance 
and/or needing to maintain appropriate visa status, must register for a 
minimum of 1 unit each semester until final copies of the dissertation 
are submitted to the Graduate Student Academic Services Office. While 1 
unit satisfies Continuous Enrollment, it does NOT meet requirements 
for&nbsp;<a href="https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/enrollment-policies" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">full-time status<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>.&nbsp;
 Students receiving funding such as assistantships, fellowships, loans, 
grants, scholarships or traineeships may be required by their funding 
source to register for more than 1 unit to meet full-time status 
requirements.&nbsp; Students should check with those funding sources 
regarding such requirements to ensure that they remain qualified for 
funding.</p>

<p>Doctoral students do not have to register for graduate units during 
Summer or Winter term unless they plan to make use of University 
facilities or faculty time. If they plan to utilize facilities or 
faculty time they must enroll for a minimum of 1 unit of graduate 
credit.&nbsp; However, if a student has maintained continuous enrollment
 (including registration in the preceding semester) and will only take 
the Final Oral Exam (the defense), make the final dissertation 
submission for graduation, or take the comprehensive examinations during
 the summer or winter term, registration is not required.</p>

<p>Unless excused by an official Leave of Absence (which may not exceed 
one year throughout the student's degree program), all graduate students
 are subject to the Continuous Enrollment Policy and must pay in-state 
and out-of-state tuition and fees in order to remain in the program. If 
the student fails to obtain a Leave of Absence or maintain continuous 
enrollment, he or she will be required to apply for re-admission and to 
pay the Graduate College application fee, and pay all overdue tuition 
and fees, including cumulative late penalties. There is no guarantee of 
re-admission. No tuition or registration waivers can be applied 
retroactively.&nbsp; Any student considering re-application should first
 check with the Graduate Student Academic Services Office to see whether
 additional work or updated forms will be necessary.</p>

<p>Please note that&nbsp;"continuous enrollment"&nbsp;is not the same 
as&nbsp;"full time enrollment"&nbsp;for financial aid purposes. Please 
refer to the University policy on&nbsp;<a href="https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/enrollment-policies" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Full-Time Status<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="time-limitation"></a>Time Limitation</h2>

<p>All requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must be 
completed within 5 years of passing the Comprehensive Exam. Programs may
 have more stringent time to degree requirements. &nbsp;Should a student
 not finish within that time period, he or she may be allowed to re-take
 the Comprehensive Exam with permission of the program, and then proceed
 to complete other requirements, e.g., the dissertation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="qualifying-examination"></a>Qualifying Examination</h2>

<p>A qualifying examination or diagnostic evaluation may be required to 
demonstrate acceptability to pursue the doctorate as well as to 
determine areas of study where further course work is necessary. Please 
review the requirements of the program for more information.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="major-professor"></a>Major Professor</h2>

<p>The major professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. The 
head of the student's major department may designate a temporary major 
professor (advisor) for incoming students. During the first year, 
students should select a major professor who must be approved by the 
department head. Students may change major professors with departmental 
approval, but are required to have a major professor in order to 
maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="plan-of-study"></a>Plan of Study</h2>

<p>In conjunction with his/her major professor or advisor, each student 
is responsible for developing a Plan of Study during their first year in
 residence, to be filed with the Graduate College no later than the 
student's third semester in residence. The Plan of Study identifies</p>

<ol><li>Courses the student intends to transfer from other institutions;</li>
	<li>Courses already completed at the University of Arizona which the student intends to apply toward the graduate degree; and</li>
	<li>Additional course work to be completed in order to fulfill degree requirements.</li>
</ol><p>The Plan of Study must have the approval of the student's major 
professor and department head (or Director of Graduate Studies) before 
it is submitted to the Graduate College.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="comprehensive-exam"></a>Comprehensive Examination for Advancement to Candidacy</h2>

<p>Before admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree, the student 
must pass a written and an oral Doctoral Comprehensive Examination. This
 examination is intended to test the student's comprehensive knowledge 
of the major and minor subjects of study, both in breadth across the 
general field of study and in depth within the area of specialization. 
The examination, therefore, should not take place until the student has 
completed all, or almost all, of their coursework. The Comprehensive 
Examination is considered a single examination, although it consists of 
written and oral parts. While the Graduate College sets general policies
 and guidelines for exams, it is expected that each program will have 
different ways of assessing a student's knowledge of the field and their
 preparation to begin the dissertation. Each program determines the 
format and administration of the written portion. The minor department 
controls the minor portion of the written examination and may waive it 
at their discretion.&nbsp; A student will pass the written portion 
before sitting for the oral portion. Programs will have written policies
 regarding whether or not students may retake failed written exams as 
well as specific policies regarding second attempts of the oral. The 
time between the written and oral portion is determined by individual 
programs, but the oral portion should come early enough to allow the 
student to advance to candidacy in a timely fashion. Normally, the 
written and oral portions of the comprehensive examination should take 
place at least three months prior to the Final Oral Examination (defense
 of dissertation). The exact time and place of the oral comprehensive 
examination must be scheduled with the department and announced in 
GradPath using the Announcement of Doctoral Comprehensive Exam form 
before the exam can take place.<br><br>
	Upon successful completion of the written portion of the examination, the&nbsp;<a href="http://arizona.app.box.com/v/grad-gsas-comporalexam" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Oral Comprehensive Examination<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>&nbsp;is
 conducted before the examining committee of the faculty. The oral 
portion of the examination must cover both the major and the 
minor.&nbsp;The Oral Comprehensive Examination should last for at least 
an hour but must not last more than 3 hours. Remote participation by one
 or more committee member by video or phone conference is permitted on 
the condition that the student and all committee members can effectively
 communicate.&nbsp; All members must participate in the entire 
examination.&nbsp; The oral examination is the occasion when faculty 
committee members have both the opportunity and obligation to require 
the student to display a broad knowledge of the chosen field of study 
and sufficient depth of understanding in areas of specialization.&nbsp; 
Discussion of proposed dissertation research may be included.&nbsp; The 
examining committee must attest that the student has demonstrated the 
professional level of knowledge expected of a junior academic colleague.
 The Graduate College allows no more than one re-take of the oral exam.<br><br>
	When the student has passed the written and oral portions of the 
Comprehensive Examination, and the Graduate Student Academic Services 
office has confirmed completion of the required courses on the approved 
doctoral Plan of Study, the student will advance to doctoral 
candidacy.&nbsp; The student will be billed the&nbsp;<a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/financial-resources/costs/degree-audit-processing-fee" target="_blank">graduate candidacy fees</a>&nbsp;and
 will be notified by e-mail of the advancement and fees. The candidacy 
fees are one-time fees and the student will not be billed again if the 
reported graduation date is changed. Students required to do a terminal 
internship or clinical residency during their final semester (Clinical 
Psychology and School Psychology) may advance to doctoral candidacy 
while enrolled in this internship or clinical residency course. Please 
consult with your Graduate College Degree Counselor to confirm your 
eligibility.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="comprehensive-exam-committee"></a>Comprehensive Examination Committee</h2>

<p>The student is responsible for forming a comprehensive examination 
committee that can examine her or him on the major and minor fields to 
confirm competency in those areas as identified by policy or in pre-exam
 consultations.&nbsp; The examining committee must consist of a minimum 
of four members. The Major Advisor and two additional members must be 
current tenured, or&nbsp;tenure track faculty members, or approved 
tenure equivalent. The fourth member may be tenured or tenure-track, or 
an&nbsp;approved special member. Special members must be pre-approved by
 the Dean of the Graduate College. Any members beyond the fourth can 
also be current tenured or tenure-track faculty members, 
or&nbsp;approved special members.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="dissertation-prospectus"></a>Dissertation Prospectus/Proposal</h2>

<p>Every student in a doctoral program needs to have an approved 
dissertation prospectus or proposal on file within their department. 
&nbsp;As soon as the student has an approved prospectus/proposal on file
 within the department, the department's Graduate Coordinator will 
submit the prospectus/proposal confirmation form in GradPath on behalf 
of the student.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="committee-appointment-form"></a>Committee Appointment Form</h2>

<p>When the student has an approved doctoral Plan of Study on file, has 
satisfied all course work, language, and residence requirements, and 
passed the written and oral portions of the Comprehensive Examination, 
he or she must file a Committee Appointment form. Any changes to the 
committee should be reported to the&nbsp;Graduate Student Academic 
Services&nbsp;office.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, submission is 
expected at least six months before the Final Oral Examination (i.e., 
Defense).&nbsp; Deadlines for the submission of paperwork pertaining to 
doctoral programs are available online at&nbsp;<a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/academics/degree-certification/deadlines-for-graduation" target="_blank">Deadlines for Completion of Degree Requirements</a>.</p>

<p>The Committee Appointment form reports the student’s planned 
dissertation committee, dissertation title (subject to change) and the 
expected graduation term.&nbsp;It requires approval from the 
dissertation director and the major and minor departments.&nbsp;The 
approval signature from the minor department on this form indicates both
 approval of the reported dissertation committee and confirmation that 
the student has satisfied all requirements for the minor.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="dissertation"></a>Dissertation</h2>

<p>All Ph.D. programs require the completion of a dissertation which 
meets required standards of scholarship and demonstrates the candidate's
 ability to conduct original research.</p>

<p>The structure of the dissertation varies depending upon the 
discipline and the program offering the degree. See the program's 
handbook for the details of how your program structures their 
dissertation requirement. A common measure of quality of the 
dissertation is whether it is "publishable" in disciplinarily-recognized
 publication venues. Note that the determination of whether a 
dissertation meets this criteria lies solely with scholars on the 
dissertation committee. Programs and committees may <strong><em>not</em></strong>
 require that the work actually be published. The committee cannot 
require that outside actors such as editors, publishers, editorial 
reviewer, accreditation boards, etc. make that determination for 
them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Research involving human subjects or vertebrate animals requires 
permission from the relevant University committee. Consult your research
 director and the&nbsp;<a href="http://orcr.vpr.arizona.edu/" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Office for the Responsible Conduct of Research<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>&nbsp;for details. Their telephone number is (520) 626-5515.</p>

<p>Research activities involving the use of human subjects require the review and approval of the&nbsp;<a href="http://orcr.arizona.edu/hspp" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">University Human Subjects Committee<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>.</p>

<p>Any research involving vertebrate animals must be approved by the&nbsp;<a href="http://orcr.arizona.edu/IACUC" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>&nbsp;(IACUC). The student must be listed on an approved IACUC protocol before they begin their animal research.</p>

<p>Instructions relating to the format of the dissertation and required abstracts are included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/gsas/dissertations-theses/dissertation-and-thesis-formatting-guides">Dissertation Formatting Guide</a>&nbsp;(including
 those that include previously published papers, papers accepted for 
publication, and/or papers with multiple authors).</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="dissertation-committee"></a>Dissertation Committee</h2>

<p>Students will form a dissertation committee by the time of 
advancement to candidacy. Some departments require earlier committee 
formulation. Individual faculty members may decline membership on 
committees for academic reasons. Candidates must be able to develop a 
proposal of sufficient academic merit and on a topic that satisfies 
their committee. Candidates can be suspended if they do not have an 
approved dissertation chair and committee.</p>

<p>The Graduate College requires a minimum of three members, all of whom
 must be current University of Arizona faculty members that 
are&nbsp;tenured, tenure-track, or approved as tenure equivalent. If a 
committee has only three members, all must approve the dissertation. In 
departments that require four or five members, there may be one 
dissenting vote. The fourth member may be tenured or tenure-track, or 
an&nbsp;approved special member. Special members must be pre-approved by
 the Dean of the Graduate College. Any members beyond the fourth can 
also be tenured or tenure-track, or approved special members. All 
dissertation committee members are expected to attend the entire final 
defense.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="final-oral-defense"></a>Final Oral Defense Examination</h2>

<p>Upon the completion of the dissertation, the candidate&nbsp;must 
submit to a Final Oral Defense Examination. A student must be in good 
academic standing to schedule the defense. The examination focuses on 
the dissertation itself but can include general questioning related to 
the field(s) of study within the scope of the dissertation (<a href="https://arizona.app.box.com/v/grad-gsas-finaldefnsinstr" target="_blank" class="ext" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Final Oral Defense Instructions<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>).</p>

<p>The date, time, and location of the final examination must be 
scheduled with the Graduate College in advance using the Announcement of
 Final Oral Defense form in GradPath.&nbsp; This form should be 
submitted far enough in advance of the examination that all approvers 
can grant their approval in time for the form to reach the Graduate 
College one week prior to the exam.&nbsp; The Graduate College will 
place an announcement on the UA master calendar to invite the public to 
attend the candidate's presentation of his or her work.&nbsp; Final Oral
 Examinations should be scheduled during days when the university is in 
session and during normal business hours. Permission to hold 
examinations during University holiday closures or outside of normal 
university business hours may be granted by Graduate College.</p>

<p>The dissertation director presides over the examination. The initial 
seminar portion during which the student presents the dissertation and 
entertains questions is open to the public. &nbsp;This is followed by a 
closed session with just the committee and the candidate.&nbsp;The 
committee's deliberation is closed to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no minimum time limit for the Final Oral Examination, but 
the entire proceedings may not exceed three hours. Members of the 
committee must be present for the entire examination.&nbsp;Should 
special circumstances require a member to attend remotely, prior 
permission from the Graduate College is necessary.</p>

<p>If the committee requires revisions, those must be done in a timely 
manner, not to exceed one year.&nbsp; If the revisions are not completed
 by the dissertation submission deadline for the term when the student 
defends, the student will be required to register for the next semester 
and will graduate in the semester when the revisions are complete and 
approved.&nbsp; If revisions are not done&nbsp;by the end of the time to
 degree period, the student will have to re-take comprehensive 
examinations to demonstrate currency of knowledge.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="submission-of-dissertation"></a>Submission of the Dissertation</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion of the Final Oral Defense examination, and
 having gained final approval from the dissertation committee after 
completing any revisions needed following the defense, the candidate 
submits the dissertation electronically via the <a href="http://www.etdadmin.com/cgi-bin/school?siteId=63" class="ext" target="_blank" rel=" noopener noreferrer">submission website<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a> maintained by ProQuest/UMI.&nbsp; This submission must be made by the <a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/gsas/degree-requirements/important-degree-dates-and-deadlines">submission deadline</a>
 for the desired graduation term.&nbsp; The Graduate College will check 
the formatting of the submitted dissertation and may request changes 
before accepting the submission.&nbsp; When the dissertation has been 
accepted by the Graduate College, <a href="#Completion of Requirements">completion of requirements</a> has been fulfilled, and all other <a href="https://grad.arizona.edu/forms/sites/default/files/uagc_page/etdsubmissiontoapprovalinformationsheet.pdf">final items</a>

<h2><a name="store-publish-dissertation"></a>Storage and Publication of Dissertation</h2>

<p>ProQuest/UMI catalogs and stores the dissertation and sends catalog 
information to the Library of Congress for distribution for depository

<p>Publication of the dissertation by ProQuest and the Campus Repository
 does not preclude publication by other means, and successful candidates
 are urged to submit dissertation material for publication in a 
scholarly or professional journals. Suitable acknowledgment must 
indicate the publication was a dissertation, or portion of a 
dissertation, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for 
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona.</p>

<h2><a name="second-doctorate"></a> Second Doctoral Degrees</h2>

<p>Persons holding a Ph.D. who wish to expand their training are 
encouraged to pursue post-doctoral training, a graduate certificate, or a
 professional degree (e.g. MD, JD, PharmD).&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rare case a
 graduate program wishes to admit a student for a 2nd Ph.D., the case 
must be justified by the department in a petition subject to approval by
 the Graduate College. The department must explain why the 2nd Ph.D. 
would be qualitatively different from the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule 
applies to cases where the first degree is from the University of 
Arizona or from another domestic or international institution.&nbsp; 
Admission to a second Ph.D. will be allowed only with strong rationale 
from the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;If admitted for a second doctoral degree, 
students will be held to all the usual degree requirements and 
University regulations pertaining to fees, registrations, examinations, 
advancement to candidacy, residency, internships, etc. Not more than 9 
credits from the prior degree may be applied toward the second 
degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants who already have a doctoral degree may not
 be given special preference for admission or for financial support.</p>

<div>Students sometimes want to pursue a UA master’s along with a UA 
doctorate in a different major.&nbsp;This is allowed, subject to the 
following restrictions:</div>

<ul><li>No credit may be counted for more than two degrees.&nbsp;Thus UA
 credits could not be used for a master’s in UA major 1, a doctorate in 
UA major 1, and a master’s in UA major 2.</li>
	<li>A student may use no more than a total of 30 credits from all 
master’s degrees toward a doctorate.&nbsp;Thus, if a student earned a 
non-UA master’s, up to 30 credits could be used toward a UA 
doctorate.&nbsp;In that case, none of the transfer credit nor any 
additional coursework toward the UA doctorate could be used toward a UA 
master’s in a major that differs from the doctorate because the student 
would have exhausted the 30 credit limit of master’s coursework that can
 be shared with a doctorate.</li>
