This is a subset of the metadata I have not yet figure out what to do with. The list of metadata to be created is avalible from https://github.com/kaiiam/phd/wiki/Planet_microbe_ontology_terms

# OSD

//Note for OSD not all of the samples are collected from Marine systems, there are lakes rivers and estuaries as well.

Carbon, organic, dissolved //dissolved organic carbon
Carbon, organic, particulate //particulate organic carbon
Date/Time of event
Nitrogen, organic, dissolved //dissolved organic nitrogen
Nitrogen, organic, particulate //particulate organic nitrogen


# TARA_Env_context

Date/Time of event
Density, sigma-theta (0) //potential density in TARA_ENV_Con, HOT_Niskin and BATS_bottle
Depth, bottom/max
Depth, top/min
Fluorescence, colored dissolved organic matter //Fluorescence of dissolved organic matter
Size fraction, lower threshold: //filter fraction shows up quite a bit in this field
Size fraction, upper threshold: //filter fraction shows up quite a bit in this field

//looks like these parameters are about the experimental growth medium in which the transcriptomics experiments were conducted not about the original seawater where they orginate thus I can't use the same semantics concentration of x in seawater for these. It would have to be in artifical seawater (or similar) Depends on how we decide to deal with the concentrations of terms. and graph searching.
