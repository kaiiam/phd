Homework 1.

In class, you were assigned to a project group with a dataset from the human microbiome that you will use for completing your homework and final project. 

Based on this dataset find a related article in google scholar. For example, the article the data were originally created for (you can often find a link by searching for the project record associated with an accession number for your dataset at NCBI)

1. Read the Koskella et al. paper to get some ideas for the types of questions you can ask of a microbiome dataset, and in particular yours!

2. Read the paper associated with your data.

3. Answer the following questions:

a. What was the overall purpose of the study?

b. What data did they collect? (e.g. #samples, sampling site, disease state, sampling time, etc) 

c. What sequencing technologies did they use? (amplicon, whole genome shotgun, or both?)

d. What scientific questions did they address? (see Koskella et al. )

e. What were the major findings of the study? 

f. Does your data overlap with this study (check the methods for accession numbers)? What scientific questions might you ask given your dataset?
