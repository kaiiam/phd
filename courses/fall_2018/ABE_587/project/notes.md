from one of our samples I was able to find the ncbi accession number: SRS147022 which is [Metagenomics of human microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRS147022)

it has 2 experiments:

[SRX153985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX153985[accn])

[SRX055059](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX055059[accn])
