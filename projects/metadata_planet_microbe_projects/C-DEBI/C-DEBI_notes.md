C-DEBI data is available for download for download via the BCO-DMO for example this link
https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/737962/data/download


From Ben Tully we got this link for the [C-DEBI project page on BCO-DMO](https://www.bco-dmo.org/program/554979)

We'll need to get the relevant BCO-DMO dataset accession numbers, as there are a variety of projects and we need to decide which of it will be put into planet microbe. Presumably the projects with non-16S omics data, and then if they have any corresponding physiochem data? Do we want just metagenomic data? or also 16S amplicons?


**List of non-16S omics data**

## [Vent_CSP_SAG](https://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/dataset/vent_csp_sag/)
