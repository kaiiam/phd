# transfer credits?

ABE  910 - Thesis | ABE  909 - Master's Report  //perhaps I can get transfer credits from my masters thesis to this course which is upto 16 credit units. *I have to find out how many ETCS my M.Sc thesis was worth or perhaps the whole thing into credits like this?

# STAT Requirements

in order to take  STAT  571B - Design of Experiments I need:
  MATH 223 or equivalent; //UBC vector Calc should be equivalent
  MATH  517A - Group Theory
    MATH 511B.
      MATH 511A.
        MATH 413
          MATH 323.
            MATH 215 or MATH 313. // MATH 215 is like the UBC linear algebra I took.
        MATH 415A.
